# CUPID

![Cupid splash screen](assets/CUPID.jpg)


This is a program I wrote in 1990 as the final project for a class in Artificial Intelligence at Virginia Tech. I am releasing it publicly as a learning exercise and to demonstrate how much technology has changed in 30 years and, in some ways, how little it has.

This program implements some basic AI principals which, at the time, were cutting edge. Nueral networks, expert systems, hueristics and non-determinism in computers were not really common topics.

The program implemets a system to match people, for the purposes of dating, with other users, based on their Myers-Briggs personality temperment. 

The program is **not** rooted in ssience, but rahter, it offers hueristics based on my, and several other friend's, expereince with dating at the ripe old age of 20. The exact values assinged to the various rules of the expert system and the matching huertic weights are not based on any real scientific work; however, the general idea of using the Myers-Briggs to build an AI was novel and not known to me, or my professor, or his wife, who taught psychology at Virginia Tech.

All source code and the README's, complete with spelling errors (there was no spell checking in Turbo Pascal in 1990) are included. A release with fully funcational exe files that will run in DOSBOX is also provided.

For context, this program was written on a 1987-era IBM PS/2 Model 30, with 640KB of RAM and a 20MB hard disk. There was no internet at the time. Any communication we were lucky enough to have was via a telephone modem at 19,200 bps to a local BBS (buliten board system).

Dr. Morton Nadler was the professor of the class. Each student was required to submit a *unique* final project; no two students could work on a project teogether, nor could two students submit a substantianlly similar project. Chess was not allowed at all as a final project.
